Durable decisions and rationale live here. Live task state belongs in
`docs/current-state.json`; task plans belong in `docs/execplans/`.

- Date: 2026-04-21
- Task: T001
- Decision: Use a thin dual-client setup with Claude as planner/orchestrator/reviewer and Codex as implementer.
- Why: This keeps planning, implementation, and review roles explicit while preserving the shared repo as source of truth.
- Consequence: Branch and worktree ownership must stay visible in the active execplan and current-state file.

- Date: 2026-04-21
- Task: T001
- Decision: Keep `PRODUCT_VISION.md` as the canonical product vision and use `docs/vision.md` only as a short AI-facing adapter.
- Why: The full product strategy already exists in the root planning spine; duplicating it in AI workflow docs would create drift.
- Consequence: AI agents should read the adapter for fast orientation but resolve product questions against `PRODUCT_VISION.md`.

- Date: 2026-04-21
- Task: T001
- Decision: Use `docs/ai-playbook.md` as the shared workflow home instead of duplicating process rules in `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`.
- Why: Shared process belongs in one canonical location; root instruction files should stay short and role-specific.
- Consequence: `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` point to the playbook for repo-state gates, approval gates, validation, and handoff rules.

- Date: 2026-04-21
- Task: T001
- Decision: Treat `AUDIT.md` and `AGENT_STATUS.md` as historical recovery material, not active canonical instruction sources.
- Why: They contain useful recovery evidence but also stale and wrong-repo content.
- Consequence: Useful current rules should be migrated into `docs/ai-playbook.md`, `docs/current-state.json`, `docs/decisions.md`, or task execplans before any future archive/delete action.

- Date: 2026-04-21
- Task: T001
- Decision: GitHub Project #6 remains the active execution board for backlog placement and sprint tracking.
- Why: The repo docs should stay high-level and should not duplicate the full backlog tree.
- Consequence: Durable product or roadmap consequences may be mirrored into repo docs, but active backlog state should stay in GitHub Project #6.

- Date: 2026-04-21
- Task: Op 2 (OSS unification)
- Decision: Force-update `origin/main` from `b8bc34c` to the PR #90 merge commit `9446998`, preserving the old `main` tip as annotated tag `oss-main-pre-unify`. Path B (archive + force-update) over Path A (merge --allow-unrelated-histories). PR #90 merged first as a merge commit to preserve review history (Option A ordering).
- Why: `origin/main` and the real codebase had unrelated histories. Preserving both lineages permanently in main would make the public OSS story permanently confusing. No multi-user or paid work exists yet, so the force-update cost is low and one-time. The archive tag preserves provenance.
- Consequence: From now on, PRs target `main` directly. The `codex/job-catalog-foundation*` private lanes are retired. Any external clone of the old main must hard-reset. Rollback command is recorded in `docs/current-state.json` under `op2_lane.rollback_command`.

- Date: 2026-04-21
- Task: T002 (authoring MVP)
- Decision: Option C (hybrid) for the author/revise layer. Deterministic contracts (`AuthoringCaseContext`, `GeneratedApplicationPackage`, `DocumentValidationResult`) stay JobPipe-native and must not import any agent framework. crewAI (if adopted later) enters only behind a JobPipe-owned adapter inside the author/revise module, which has a typed, framework-agnostic interface.
- Why: Data is the product. JobPipe is the engine. Locking contracts to any one agent framework (crewAI or otherwise) would trade the product's differentiator for short-term velocity. Keeping the runtime layer swappable preserves the replaceability principle we apply to reactive-resume and jobsync.
- Consequence: Any slice that imports `crewai` into the contract layer is a routing violation and must be rejected in review. The "no `crewai` import in contract modules or their tests" rule must appear as acceptance criteria on every T002 slice that touches contracts.

- Date: 2026-05-06
- Task: pipeline hardening / date normalisation
- Decision: Normalise `applicationDue` to ISO `YYYY-MM-DD` at ingest in `pull_sheets_csv`, not only in the downstream sync tools.
- Why: Multiple formats arrive from Google Sheets (`dd.mm.yyyy`, `dd/mm/yyyy`, `dd-mm-yyyy`). Normalising only in `sync_ledger` / `sync_evaluations` means raw connector JSONL files, the intake queue, and any consumer that reads `ctx.job["applicationDue"]` directly (triage prompt header, `application_pack`, `profile_match`) all see the un-normalised value. Root normalisation ensures every downstream consumer receives consistent ISO dates.
- Consequence: `pull_sheets_csv._normalize_due()` is the canonical normalisation point. `sync_ledger._parse_date_maybe()` and `sync_evaluations._parse_date_maybe()` remain as safety nets for records already queued. Any future connector that writes `applicationDue` must normalise to ISO before appending to the connector JSONL.

- Date: 2026-05-06
- Task: pipeline hardening / date normalisation
- Decision: Use `str.startswith(_OPEN_DEADLINE_PREFIXES)` (prefix match) rather than exact set membership for open-deadline keywords (`snarest`, `asap`, `fortløpende`, `løpende`, `rolling`).
- Why: Real job postings use `snarest mulig`, `snarest mulig oppstart`, etc. An exact-match check silently misses multi-word variants, letting them reach `parse_iso()` which returns the epoch sentinel — effectively treating "rolling deadline" as an unknown that could be skipped by the expiry filter.
- Consequence: `_OPEN_DEADLINE_PREFIXES` in `pull_sheets_csv` and `_common.py` are the two canonical locations. Any new open-deadline synonym must be added to both. The prefix approach means a value beginning with one of the prefixes is always treated as open regardless of what follows — this is intentional and acceptable.

- Date: 2026-05-06
- Task: pipeline hardening / schema validation
- Decision: Use a Pydantic `before`-mode `field_validator` on `AdvantageAssessmentV3` to truncate long LLM-generated strings to 237 chars + "…" rather than raising `ValidationError`.
- Why: LLMs occasionally produce strings slightly over the 240-char display limit. A hard `ValidationError` propagates as a `pipeline_error.json`, leaving the job with no `final_decision` in the ledger — silently losing a potentially good lead. Truncating is always preferable to losing the record; the display cap exists for UI density, not data integrity.
- Consequence: The truncation applies to `recruiter_hook`, `applicant_pool_hypothesis`, and `summary` on `AdvantageAssessmentV3`. If other models show similar over-length failures, apply the same pattern. Do not raise `ValidationError` for cosmetic display-length limits.

- Date: 2026-05-06
- Task: pipeline hardening / code deduplication
- Decision: `jobpipe/stages/pipeline.py::build_stages` is the single source of truth; `run_feed.py` imports from it.
- Why: `run_feed.py` carried a ~160-line duplicate of `build_stages` that was missing `triage_profile_summary`, `targeting_title_patterns`, and all v3 `cache_key_fn` parameters. The live path always used `run_feed.py`'s version (which shadowed `pipeline.py`), so no behaviour changed, but the drift created a latent correctness risk and confused future contributors about which definition was authoritative.
- Consequence: `pipeline.py::build_stages` must always be kept current. `run_feed.py` must never re-introduce a local `build_stages`. Any new stage added to the supported order must be wired in `pipeline.py`.

- Date: 2026-05-08
- Task: S5-HUB-PLAN-01
- Decision: Name the backend-side common connection point `ApplicationWorkspaceHub` and make it the owner of JobDesk-facing backend capability contracts, projections, command boundaries, adapter routing, and provenance-safe payloads.
- Why: JobDesk needs a stable backend contract that can connect JobPipe, JobSane, JobData, Reactive Resume, future API/MCP wrappers, SQLite/artifacts, and later Supabase without depending on the legacy dashboard or exposing storage internals.
- Consequence: New JobDesk integration work must target ApplicationWorkspaceHub capabilities first. The old dashboard may be referenced for behavior but must not become the dependency for JobDesk pathways.

- Date: 2026-05-08
- Task: S5-HUB-01
- Decision: Place the initial hub contract skeleton in `jobpipe.workspace`, with storage-agnostic value objects in `jobpipe.workspace.contracts` and capability protocols in `jobpipe.workspace.hub`.
- Why: The contracts need a neutral package that is not tied to the old dashboard, CLI server, storage adapter, API transport, or any single companion project.
- Consequence: Future storage adapters, API/MCP wrappers, and JobDesk-facing projections must depend on `jobpipe.workspace` contracts instead of importing dashboard-era payloads.

- Date: 2026-05-08
- Task: S5-SB-01
- Decision: Treat hosted JobData Supabase as a NAV intake source only, feeding the existing JobPipe connector staging seam through `pull_supabase_jobs.py` and `drain_queue.py`.
- Why: Supabase already contains NAV-ingested rows, but JobDesk's case read model is owned by JobDeskIntegrationGateway/ApplicationWorkspaceHub. The smallest safe integration is to map Supabase NAV rows into existing JobPipe intake records, then let the normal JobPipe run, catalog, SQLite, and artifact path own downstream outputs.
- Consequence: Supabase NAV intake must not become a direct JobDesk dependency, ApplicationWorkspaceHub storage adapter, old-dashboard dependency, or write-back path. Future work should harden the existing puller and tests before adding any Supabase output/status adapter.
