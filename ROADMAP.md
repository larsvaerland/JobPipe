# Roadmap

## Current phase

JobPipe is in a consolidation phase:

- the runtime model is being cleaned up around the primary DB
- repo-local noise is being pushed out of the codebase
- docs are being aligned with the actual operating model

The purpose of this phase is to make the system easier to trust, easier to run, and easier to evolve.

## Now

These are the next high-value items for the current single-user, local-first product:

1. Improve candidate-state quality so profile, resume, application history, and calibration stay coherent in the primary DB.
2. Strengthen advantageous-match detection so JobPipe surfaces roles the candidate is genuinely competitive for, including non-obvious titles.
3. Harden daily operation: scheduled runs, source reliability, and clearer failure handling.
4. Keep the dashboard focused on actionable, winnable opportunities rather than reporting noise.
5. Improve application-pack quality so generated material is genuinely useful with minimal editing.
6. Finish documentation cleanup so public docs, internal specs, and runtime behavior agree.

## Next

After the current cleanup phase, the next product layer should be:

1. stronger multi-source intake
2. better deduplication across source records
3. better market-translation signals across adjacent role families
4. clearer advantageous-match signals in the dashboard and exports
5. better feedback loops from status and outcome data
6. richer dashboard views for expiring jobs, source quality, and generated documents

## Later

Only after the local-first model is stable:

1. optional Postgres-backed deployment using the same domain model
2. candidate-specific configuration workflows beyond direct file editing
3. broader multi-user support
4. selective embedding and retrieval improvements where they solve a proven problem

## Explicit non-goals for now

- full ATS feature parity
- mass auto-apply
- broad workflow automation beyond the current job-search loop
- premature UI surface for every internal setting
- vector-database-first architecture
- title-keyword matching as the primary product strategy
