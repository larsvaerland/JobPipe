# Claude Agent Instructions: JobPipe / Agentic JobPilot

## Read these files first — every session, no exceptions

Before writing any code or making any changes, read these three files in order:

1. **`AGENT_STATUS.md`** — shared memory bus. Current state of all workstreams, what's been changed, open cross-agent requests.
2. **`AUDIT.md`** — deep audit log. Open bugs, data quality issues, tech debt. Check your section; fix what you can.
3. **`PRODUCT_VISION.md`** — product goals, success metrics, design principles, roadmap. Align your work with it.

After making changes: **update your sections in AGENT_STATUS.md and AUDIT.md**.

## What this repo is

An AI-powered job hunting pipeline that pulls jobs from a Google Sheet (sourced from NAV's pam-stilling-feed API), runs a staged agentic triage + scoring pipeline (OpenAI Agents SDK), writes per-job JSON artifacts, and produces a self-contained HTML dashboard.

**Design principles (from PRODUCT_VISION.md):**
1. **Cheap before smart** — free filters (geo, regex) before any LLM call. Always.
2. **Never miss a strong match** — safety overrides catch false negatives even when the LLM says SKIP.
3. **Every decision is debuggable** — every stage writes a JSON artifact. No hidden logic.
4. **Incremental, not monolithic** — process deltas, not the full feed.
5. **Human in the loop** — the system recommends, Lars decides. No auto-apply.

## Architecture

```
NAV API (pam-stilling-feed)
    ↓ Apps Script (trigger-based, ~hourly, 50 jobs/run)
Google Sheet (JobFeed tab, ~35,850 rows × 59 cols)
    ↓ pull_sheets_csv.py (pulls delta, writes jobs_delta.jsonl)
jobs_delta.jsonl
    ↓ run_feed.py / drain_queue.py
    ├─ [FREE]  Geo postal filter    → SKIP if outside 0xxx/1xxx/3xxx/4xxx
    ├─ [FREE]  Hard-no title regex  → SKIP on irrelevant titles
    ├─ [FREE]  Semantic pre-filter  → cosine similarity vs profile (multilingual-MiniLM, threshold 0.45)
    ├─ [NANO]  Triage               → SKIP / REVIEW / APPLY signal + noise_level score
    ├─ [MINI]  Parse                → structured job requirements
    ├─ [MINI]  Profile match        → fit_score 0-100 (4 dimensions: role/domain/seniority/skills)
    ├─ [MINI]  Pivot                → pivot_score 0-100
    ├─ [FREE]  Moderate             → final_decision (deterministic thresholds)
    └─ [DEEP]  Application pack     → deepagents + FilesystemBackend, only for APPLY / APPLY_STRONGLY
    # Reverse triage disabled — redundant given current triage accuracy. Re-enable in YAML if needed.
    ↓
out_runs/<run_id>/<job_id>/         per-job JSON artifacts
    ↓ sync_ledger.py
reports/ledger.sqlite               deduplicated, latest state per job
    ↓ export_dashboard.py
reports/dashboard.html              self-contained HTML, opens in browser
```

## Stage pipeline detail

### Per-job artifact layout

```
out_runs/<run_id>/<job_id>/
  00_input.json          normalized job snapshot (always written)
  01_triage.json         AI triage result
  02_reverse_triage.json only when triage=SKIP and NOT geo-skip or hard-no
  03_parsed.json
  04_profile_match.json
  05_pivot.json
  06_moderator.json
  07_application_pack.json  only for APPLY / APPLY_STRONGLY

out_runs/<run_id>/index.jsonl   run summary (one line per job)
```

### Stage factory interface

```python
def stage_factory(...) -> tuple[should_run_fn, run_fn]:
    def should_run(ctx: JobContext) -> bool: ...
    def run(ctx: JobContext, job_dir: Path) -> dict: ...
    return should_run, run
```

`run_feed.py` wraps these into `Stage(name, should_run, run, out_filename, ...)` objects.

### Decision tiers and thresholds (from `configs/pipeline.v1.yaml`)

| Threshold | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `review_min_fit` | 30 | Hard floor — SKIP regardless of pivot score |
| `review_high_min_fit` | 58 | Separates REVIEW_LOW vs REVIEW_HIGH |
| `apply_fit` | 67 | Minimum for APPLY |
| `apply_strong_fit` | 78 | Minimum for APPLY_STRONGLY |
| `pivot_boost_apply` | 78 | Pivot score needed to boost a borderline job to APPLY |
| `reverse_triage_min_conf` | 0.60 | Confidence threshold to trigger reverse triage (disabled) |
| `semantic_filter_threshold` | 0.45 | Cosine similarity floor before LLM triage (multilingual-MiniLM) |

Final decisions: `SKIP`, `REVIEW_LOW`, `REVIEW_HIGH`, `APPLY`, `APPLY_STRONGLY`

---

## Hard rules — never break these

### 1. No LLM calls before hard filters
Geo and title filtering happen in `triage.py` **before** any LLM call. This is the primary cost control. Do not move these checks or add LLM calls before them.

### 2. Geo SKIPs must not enter reverse triage
In `reverse_triage.should_run()`, return `False` if `triage_signals` contains `geo_postal_skip` or `geo_skip`. Geo blocks are hard and personal — not subject to reconsideration.

### 3. Geo filter covers four postal code ranges
Allowed: `0xxx`, `1xxx`, `3xxx`, `4xxx` (Oslo, Akershus, Vestfold/Telemark, Agder).
Regex: `^([0134])(00[1-9]|0[1-9]\d|[1-9](0[1-9]|[1-9]\d))$`
Remote/hybrid override: `(?i)(remote|fjern|hjemmekontor|hybrid)` — checked against specific work-arrangement fields + first 300 chars of description ONLY. Not the full description (causes false passes from "hybrid culture" mentions).
If no postal code AND no county/municipal fallback matches → SKIP.

### 4. Moderate stage is deterministic — no LLM
`moderate.py` applies only the YAML thresholds. No OpenAI calls here. Final decisions must be reproducible from the moderator input alone.

### 5. Every stage writes a JSON artifact
Even for skipped stages, the decision must be traceable. If a stage errors, write an error payload rather than silently failing — or ensure the pipeline continues with that job marked as failed.

### 6. Output schema is additive
When modifying a stage, preserve existing output fields. Add new fields freely. Do not rename or remove fields without also updating `sync_ledger.py`, `export_dashboard.py`, and `DASHBOARD_SPEC.md`.

### 7. YAML has no duplicate keys
`configs/pipeline.v1.yaml` must not have duplicate top-level keys (Python's yaml loader silently drops them). Keep all regex patterns quoted. Keep the `stages:` list stable unless explicitly changing the pipeline.

## CLI commands (standard / Windows PowerShell)

### One-shot runner (recommended)
```powershell
.\go.ps1              # pull + process + sync + open dashboard
.\go.ps1 -DryRun      # 2 jobs only, no browser open (test mode)
.\go.ps1 -NoOpen      # full run, skip auto-opening browser
```
`go.ps1` always uses `.venv\Scripts\python.exe` — no system Python issues.

### Manual steps (advanced)
Always use `.venv\Scripts\python.exe` to ensure deepagents and all deps are available.

#### Pull delta from Sheet
```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m jobpipe.cli.pull_sheets_csv --out .\jobs_delta.jsonl --state .\jobs_state.json --only-changed
```

#### Run pipeline (bounded)
```powershell
$env:OPENAI_AGENTS_DISABLE_TRACING="1"
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m jobpipe.cli.run_feed --jobs .\jobs_delta.jsonl --profile .\profile_pack.md --config .\configs\pipeline.v1.yaml --out .\out_runs --max 100 --overwrite
```

#### Drain queue (pull + run until done)
```powershell
$env:OPENAI_AGENTS_DISABLE_TRACING="1"
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m jobpipe.cli.drain_queue --profile .\profile_pack.md --config .\configs\pipeline.v1.yaml --out .\out_runs --state .\jobs_state.json --batch-size 100 --overwrite
```

### Sync ledger + regenerate dashboard
```powershell
python -m jobpipe.cli.sync_ledger --out .\out_runs --sqlite .\reports\ledger.sqlite --csv .\reports\ledger_latest.csv
python -m jobpipe.cli.export_dashboard
start reports\dashboard.html
```

### Mark application status (manual)
```powershell
python -m jobpipe.cli.mark_status JOB_ID shortlisted        # reviewed, intend to apply
python -m jobpipe.cli.mark_status JOB_ID applied            # application submitted
python -m jobpipe.cli.mark_status JOB_ID interview          # interview received
python -m jobpipe.cli.mark_status JOB_ID rejected --notes "Form letter"
python -m jobpipe.cli.mark_status JOB_ID dismissed          # decided not to apply
python -m jobpipe.cli.mark_status --list                    # show all tracked
python -m jobpipe.cli.mark_status --list --filter-status applied
```

### Scan Gmail for application emails (auto-detect)
```powershell
# First-time setup (one-time OAuth consent):
python -m jobpipe.cli.scan_gmail --setup

# Regular use:
python -m jobpipe.cli.scan_gmail --dry-run        # preview matches, no writes
python -m jobpipe.cli.scan_gmail                  # scan last 90 days, write updates
python -m jobpipe.cli.scan_gmail --days 30 -v     # verbose, last 30 days
```
Gmail credentials: `reports/gmail_credentials.json` (download from Google Cloud Console)
Gmail token: `reports/gmail_token.json` (auto-created after --setup)
Never overwrites manual entries. Only upgrades status (applied → interview → rejected).

### Compile check (run before every commit)
```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python.exe compile_check.py
```

### Test with small batch first
```powershell
.\go.ps1 -DryRun
```
Always test with `-DryRun` (2 jobs) before a full run.

## Working conventions

### Making changes
1. Read AGENT_STATUS.md + AUDIT.md + PRODUCT_VISION.md first.
2. Check file ownership — confirm you're not stepping on another workstream.
3. Make small, focused changes. Preserve output schemas.
4. Run compile check after every change.
5. Test with `--max 2` before `--max 100`.
6. Update your section in AGENT_STATUS.md and AUDIT.md.

### When proposing code changes
- Provide exact file paths
- Provide complete function blocks (copy/paste safe)
- Explain how to test with a single command
- Note any schema changes that affect downstream consumers (ledger, dashboard)

### Ledger and deduplication
`ledger.sqlite` has two tables:
- `ledger` — latest state per `job_id` (upserted on each sync)
- `events` — run history (one row per job per run)

`drain_queue.py` skips jobs already in the ledger by default. Use `--ledger-sqlite .\reports\ledger.sqlite` to specify a non-default path.

### Data freshness
Pipeline runs are currently manual. After each run:
1. `sync_ledger` to update `ledger.sqlite`
2. `export_dashboard` to rebuild `dashboard.html`
3. Check AGENT_STATUS.md for any cross-workstream requests that this run's data might unblock.

## Key data files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `configs/pipeline.v1.yaml` | Pipeline config — models, stages, thresholds, regex |
| `profile_pack.md` | Candidate profile — truth source for triage and matching |
| `jobs_delta.jsonl` | Input to pipeline — pulled from Google Sheet |
| `jobs_state.json` | Change tracking state for delta pull |
| `reports/ledger.sqlite` | Deduplicated job ledger (tables: `ledger`, `events`) |
| `reports/ledger_latest.csv` | CSV export of ledger for quick inspection |
| `reports/dashboard_template.html` | Dashboard HTML template (use `/*__DASHBOARD_DATA__*/` placeholder) |
| `reports/dashboard.html` | Built dashboard — self-contained, embeds data inline |
| `reports/application_state.json` | Application tracking sidecar — manual + Gmail-detected statuses |
| `reports/gmail_credentials.json` | Gmail OAuth2 client credentials (download from Google Cloud Console) |
| `reports/gmail_token.json` | Gmail OAuth2 token — auto-created by `scan_gmail --setup` |

---

## Current known issues (see AUDIT.md for full list)

- Geo classification in the dashboard may miscount — some jobs flagged as "geo-blocked" are actually moderator SKIPs at fit<30 with missing stage files. Needs explicit `skip_reason` signal.
- `triage_signals` empty for some older ledger jobs — sync_ledger didn't read `01_triage.json` during those runs.
- `scan_gmail.py` requires Gmail API credentials setup before first use — see CLI commands above.
- Semantic filter multilingual model (paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2) needs calibration — threshold currently 0.45 (conservative). Calibrate after running on 50+ jobs: check `sim:X.XX` tags in `01_triage.json`, find separation point, raise toward 0.55-0.60.
- `go.ps1 --dry-run` (double-dash) is silently ignored by PowerShell — use `.\go.ps1 -DryRun` instead.

## Agent coordination protocol

Three Cowork agents work on this project in parallel. To avoid conflicts:

1. Read AGENT_STATUS.md before every session.
2. Check "Cross-agent requests" — act on any requests addressed to your workstream.
3. After changes: update your workstream section and add any new cross-agent requests.
4. Add new audit findings to your section in AUDIT.md.
5. All significant decisions should be consistent with PRODUCT_VISION.md.
