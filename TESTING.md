# Testing

## Principles

- Prefer small targeted tests.
- Keep one smoke path for the main workflow.
- Validate behavior changes before merging.
- Do not mix broad refactors and feature work in one change unless the task is explicitly a cleanup pass.
- Docs-only planning changes do not require runtime tests, but they do require cross-doc consistency checks.

## Minimum checks for code changes

For any meaningful code change:

1. Run the most relevant targeted test.
2. Run `python compile_check.py`.
3. Run a smoke test on a small fixture or dry-run path.
4. Confirm output format is unchanged unless intentionally updated.
5. Confirm the dashboard or other key derived exports still generate as expected.

## Practical rule

Every change should include one of:

- an updated test
- a new focused test
- a short manual validation note explaining why automated coverage was not added

## Smoke test

Preferred smoke test:

```text
jobpipe run --dry-run --no-open
```

Current meaning:
- bounded local smoke path
- skips live sheet intake
- processes at most two already-queued jobs if a local delta exists
- still runs sync/export so the canonical CLI and projection path are exercised
- zero processed jobs is acceptable when the local queue is empty

Fallback:

```text
python -m jobpipe.cli.main run --dry-run --no-open
```

Windows wrapper:

```powershell
.\go.ps1 -DryRun -NoOpen
```

For a step-by-step manual validation path with explicit success and failure outcomes, use [docs/public-loop-test-howto.md](docs/public-loop-test-howto.md).

## Planning / docs-only changes

For planning and docs alignment work:

1. verify the root docs do not contradict each other
2. verify `OSS_SCOPE.md` and `DEPENDENCY_POLICY.md` match the current planning layer
3. verify `specs/architecture-boundaries.md` matches the current planning layer and roadmap sequencing
4. verify `docs/` terminology matches the current planning layer
5. verify active specs and roadmap sequencing do not drift

## What to watch closely

Changes in these areas need extra care:

- filtering thresholds
- decision tiers
- claim extraction or selection logic
- output structure
- artifact/export generation
- Gmail or mail-ingestion behavior
- config-driven behavior
- DB schema or primary-state reads/writes
