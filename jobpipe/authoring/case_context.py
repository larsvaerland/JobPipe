class AuthoringCaseContext:
    """
    Immutable authoring contract for one candidate and one job.

    Constructed from existing JobPipe state before any document generation.

    rehydrated without reaching back through runtime artifacts.

    candidate_id:
        Candidate identifier, from JobContext.meta["candidate_id"].
    job_id:
